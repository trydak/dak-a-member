## What is Trydak?

Trydak helps brands **monitor, understand, and improve** how AI talks about them.  
We track when you’re mentioned, where you show up, and what to do to win more mentions — across ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok, Perplexity, and Claude.

### What we’re building

- **Answer Engine Insights** — See where you’re mentioned and how often (think “share of voice” for AI).
- **Agent Analytics** — Understand how assistants use (or ignore) your website when answering.
- **Conversation Explorer** — Discover what millions ask AI and which topics are heating up.
- **Shopping** — Track product presence in AI shopping experiences.
- **SEO Engine for AI** — Create short, verifiable **answer capsules** and **evidence cards** AI loves to cite.

> Plain-English metrics  
> **Brand Mention Rate** = how often AI mentions you.  
> **Share of LLM Voice** = your slice of all mentions in your market.

## Why we exist

People now ask for **answers**, not links.  
If assistants don’t mention you, you’re invisible at the exact moment a decision is made.  
We help good brands earn **right-time visibility** with clear, credible content.

---

## How we work

- **Measure** where you stand today.  
- **Find gaps** and the fastest wins.  
- **Create better answers** for AI to cite.  
- **Verify** progress, then repeat.

We value **clarity over complexity**, **momentum over perfection**, and **evidence over opinions**.

## Our personality

- **Kind & sharp** — respectful tone, rigorous thinking.  
- **Small steps, daily wins** — frequent, visible progress.  
- **Write it down** — short docs beat long meetings.  
- **Default to open** — discuss in the open so everyone learns.

---

## Team rituals (short and sweet)

- **Demo Friday (30 min)** — show what we shipped and learned.  
- **Prompt Rodeo (bi-weekly)** — improve prompts and evaluation together.  
- **Docs & Donuts (monthly)** — clean up docs; kill confusion.  
- **Red Team (as needed)** — challenge assumptions; pressure-test claims.

Marketing, growth, and brand teams at enterprise and scale-ups who need to **win the mention** in AI answers — across fintech, SaaS, ecommerce, marketplaces, and more.

## A few things we don’t do

- Play guessing games — we prefer real signals.

- Over-polish — we’d rather ship, learn, and improve.

## Words we use a lot

- **Answer Engine** — AI that returns answers (not just links).  
- **Mention** — an explicit citation of your brand.  
- **Answer Capsule** — a crisp, reliable answer AI can reuse.
